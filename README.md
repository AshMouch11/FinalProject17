Trivial Escape is a text-based game that focuses on trivia questions on 3 different topics: Supernatural, Sherlock, and Math.
The game begins as the player is dropped into a 5 by 5 grid of 25 rooms, each room with 4 doors.
1 door is randomly assigned to be the "escape door." The objective of the game is to find the escape door.
Passage through each door is dependent on the giving of the correct answer to the riddle assigned to the door.
The user has 3 chances to answer the riddle correctly, or the door is locked forever.
Once the escape door is located, the user has 1 chance to answer the door's riddle correctly, or they lose the game; a correct answer wins the game.
