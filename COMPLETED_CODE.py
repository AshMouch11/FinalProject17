This Escape Door is the key to winning the game. Enter the Escape Door, answer the question correctly, and you win.
Each room has 4 doors: north, south, east, and west, which will lead you to the next room.
In order to get through the door, however, you will need to answer a question about the topic you just chose.
You will have 3 attempts to answer this question or the door will be locked forever.
If you try to go through a door at the end of the column or row, you will be brough to the other side of that same row or column.
For example, if you try the go north when you are in room 20, you will end up back in room 0.
If you lock the escape door, you LOSE.
